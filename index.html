            &emsp;&emsp;Christopher M. Sorensen is the Cortelyou-Rust University Distinguished Professor
            and a University Distinguished Teaching Scholar in the Departments of Physics and Chemistry
            (adjunct) at Kansas State University. He received a B.S. in physics from the University
            of Nebraska in 1969 where he was Phi Beta Kappa and a Woodrow Wilson Fellow. He was then
            drafted and served in Vietnam; he returned to the world to earn his PhD from the University
            of Colorado in 1977.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;Sorensen has won numerous teaching awards. In 2007 he was named the CASE/Carnegie
            Foundation United States Professor of the year for doctoral universities. A former student
            Michelle Munson, President, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Aspera endowed $1M to initiate the C. M.
            Sorensen Intellectual Property Incubator (2015). He has developed new curricula including
            hands-on studios for Engineering Physics and Descriptive Astronomy.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;Sorensen is an active scientist with nearly 300 publications, seven patents and two patents
            pending. Google Scholar lists an h-index of 66 with 16,200 citations. He is a Fellow of the
            American Physical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the
            American Association for Aerosol Research. He is a past president of the AAAR and chaired its
            annual meeting. His areas of scientific interest are light scattering, graphene synthesis,
            particulate systems and synthesis. He and his students have developed and patented a novel
            detonation synthesis of graphene; developed novel ways to understand particulate light
            scattering; developed novel nanoparticle synthesis methods and studied their solution properties
            and assembly from solution; studied gel formation in particulate dispersions; and have made
            physical measurements on water supercooled deeper than any other lab in the world.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;In his spare time Sorensen enjoys participating in sports and exercise, amateur astronomy and reading.</p>
